# 6. Working with Modules
## 6.1 Module basics
- At this point in the course, I've shown you all of the TypeScript syntax that you'll need to know in order to use TypeScript successfully in your day to day development. In this chapter, I'm going to shift the focus to using the syntax you've already learned, but in a different way. And in fact, I'm going to start by going back to a JavaScript feature, modules.
- Put simply, JavaScript modules enable you to link code that is distributed across many files. Let me demonstrate. Here is an old school JavaScript web application stored in several files. And in our webpage, we use HTML script tags to download and load each of these files into the browser's memory. 
- As we do, the contents of each file get loaded into the same shared memory space. That means that when I define a function in one file and then define another function in another file with the same name, and then load both of these files like I'm doing here, the last function to be defined overwrites any others defined before it. With modules, however, each file shares its own memory space, so any function or variables that are defined within that module stay within that memory space and do not leak out, avoiding these kinds of collisions altogether. 
- What's more, modules can load from other modules. And since just about all modern browsers understand modules, they're even able to download these other modules on the fly based only on these kinds of references. This means that we no longer have to worry about loading every file of our application up front, but instead, let the browser load them for us as they're needed. 
- Now that I've shown modules in action, check out the next video, where I take a few steps back and show you how to write module-based code from scratch and how TypeScript can help you do it.
